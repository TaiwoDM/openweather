This is an API project.
It collects data from the rest countries api. A database of 250 countries. 
API URL - https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all
I collected all of the countries and used just the name of the individual countries in the home select input. To allow users choose which countries' weather data they want to get.

Finally I used the open weather map API to get the weather data of the passed in country from the homepage
API URL - https://openweathermap.org

I only scratched through the surfaces of the data of these databases since it is just a little project. The really simple UI and dummy texts tells that already '-_-'
